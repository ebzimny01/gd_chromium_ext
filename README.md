# City Mapper for WIS Gridiron Dynasty (Chrome Extension)
Chrome Extension for mapping recruit hometowns using GDAnalyst website

## Description
This extension is for coaches who play Gridiron Dynasty on Whatifsports.com (WIS). When you search for recruits, the web page displays the recruits hometown (City, ST). This extension modifies the hometown to be a URL that opens the GDAnalyst website (gdanalyst.herokuapp.com) and leverages its mapping capability to show you where the recruit is located compared to all human coaches in that world and division.

## How To Use
I am currently waiting on the Chrome Extension to be approved and published. In the meantime, here are instructions on how to load the unpacked extension manually.

1. [Download the .zip file](https://github.com/ebzimny01/gd_chromium_ext/blob/master/gd_chromium_ext.zip) from the repository
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder location of your choice
3. Open a Chromium-based browser - e.g. Chrome or Edge
4. Enter "chrome://extensions" in the address bar and hit "ENTER" key (or "edge://extensions" if using Edge browser)
5. Enable "Developer Mode" (there is a toggle on left side of page).
6. elect "Load Unpacked Extension" (button near top of page)
7. Select the folder that you unzipped the files to in step #2 above
8. Do a Recruit Search on WIS GD
9. The recruits' hometowns should be modified with a + sign in front and have a hyperlink
10. Click on each hometown link and it will open a new tab and map the recruits location relative to human coaches in your world and division
